## Neighborhood Map

###  Functionality

* A list-view of locations around the University of Southern California is provided in the left.
* A text input field in the top could filter the map markers and list items to locations matching the text input.
* Map displays all location markers by default, and displays the filtered subset of location markers when a filter is applied.
* Clicking a location on the list displays unique information about the location, and animates its associated map marker
* Yelp ratings show in the markerâ€™s infoWindow.

You can download the code, unzip it, then open index.html, or play it on github page: https://direction123.github.io/Udacity-Neighborhood-Map/
